# OpenAlex DOI to Keywords (RIS Exporter)
This Python script takes a list of DOIs (in any format), queries the [OpenAlex API](https://openalex.org/), and exports an `.ris` file containing titles and concept keywords for use in **bibliometric tools** like [VOSviewer](https://www.vosviewer.com/).

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Accepts DOIs in **raw or URL** format (e.g. `10.1016/...`, `https://doi.org/...`)
- ✅ Automatically extracts **keywords** (concepts) from OpenAlex
- ✅ Outputs a **valid RIS** file ready for import into **VOSviewer**
- ✅ Skips invalid or non-DOI URLs (e.g. `itcon.org/2016/24`)
- ✅ Progress bar for large datasets
- 🔒 Gracefully handles errors

## 📂 How to Use

1. **Prepare your list of DOIs**

Create a plain text file called `dois.txt` in the same directory. Add one DOI or DOI URL per line:

```
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2023.102137
10.36680/j.itcon.2022.020
https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000712
```

2. **Run the script**

```bash
python get_openalex_ris.py
```

3. **Done!**

The script will output:

* `openalex_keywords.ris` → ready to import into VOSviewer

## 🗺️ Using in VOSviewer

1. Open VOSviewer
2. Select:

   * *Create a map based on bibliographic data*
   * *Read data from bibliographic database files*
3. Choose `openalex_keywords.ris`
4. Choose:

   * *Type of analysis:* Co-occurrence
   * *Unit of analysis:* All keywords

## 🧠 About OpenAlex Concepts

The "keywords" used in this script come from OpenAlex's `concepts` field, which represents semantically-tagged research topics. These are consistent and hierarchical, making them ideal for bibliometric analysis.
